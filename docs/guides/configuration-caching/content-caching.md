signageOS SMIL Player automatically caches SMIL files, all media, and widgets into the internal memory of the device to
allow playback in case there is no network connection.

## How are media handled after a device reboot? Are they re-downloaded?

The content is stored in persistent storage on the device. The SMIL Player downloads files only once (in the first SMIL
file load), then all media files and widgets are stored and available even after the device reboot.

## What happens if some content is not played anymore (SMIL changed)? Is it deleted from disk immediately?

If any media files or widgets are no longer needed they are deleted once:

- the SMIL Player reboots
- the SMIL file changes
- a new SMIL file is added
- the current SMIL file gets some media/content updated

## Is there an automatic file/cache-cleanup implemented in the device?

Any changes implemented in the SMIL file or when the new content is added, all files which are no longer needed are
removed.

## How to control update mechanisms?

### Separate Update Intervals

The SMIL Player supports independent update intervals for media files and the SMIL file itself:

```xml
<!-- Check media files every 60 seconds, SMIL file every 20 minutes -->
<meta http-equiv="Refresh" contentRefresh="60" smilFileRefresh="1200"/>
```

This separation allows:
- **Efficient bandwidth usage**: SMIL files typically change less frequently than media
- **Optimized performance**: Reduce unnecessary HEAD requests for stable playlist structures
- **Flexible strategies**: Different update frequencies for content vs playlist configuration

**Default behavior:**
- Media files: Use `contentRefresh` or `content` attribute value
- SMIL file: Checks every 24 hours (86400 seconds) by default, or use `smilFileRefresh` to customize

### Disable Media Update Checks

If you want to turn off head requests which monitor if some media files was updated, you can specify in your smil file
`onlySmilUpdate` attribute in refresh `<meta>` tag in smil header.

```xml

<meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="10" onlySmilUpdate="true"/>
```

This xml above means, that SMIL player will check for updates only original smil file and not all media which are
specified within the smil file. Smil player will check for smil file changes each 10 seconds.

If `onlySmilUpdate` is missing, the default value is false, which means the SMIL player will check all media
files for updates.

## Configuring Update Check Timeout

You can configure the timeout for HEAD requests that check for file updates using the `timeOut` attribute:

```xml
<meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="60" timeOut="5000" onlySmilUpdate="false"/>
```

- `timeOut` - Timeout in milliseconds for HEAD requests (default: 2000ms)
- This timeout applies to all update checks (SMIL file and media files)
- For slower or unstable networks, consider increasing the timeout to 5000-10000ms
- The timeout prevents the player from waiting too long when checking for updates on slow connections

## Handling Content Updates and Errors

The SMIL Player provides comprehensive content management through HTTP status codes.

### Automatic Content Skipping

Configure the player to skip content based on HTTP status codes:

```xml
<meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="60" skipContentOnHttpStatus="404"/>
```

With this configuration:
- When a media file returns HTTP 404 (Not Found), it will be automatically skipped
- The playlist continues with the next available content
- No black screens or playback interruption occurs

### Forced Content Updates

The `updateContentOnHttpStatus` attribute provides an additional update trigger mechanism alongside last-modified headers:

```xml
<!-- Force re-download on specific status codes -->
<meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="60" updateContentOnHttpStatus="200,205"/>
```

How update detection works:
1. **Primary mechanism**: Last-modified headers are checked
2. **Additional mechanism**: Status codes can force updates
3. When a configured status code is returned, content is re-downloaded regardless of last-modified

This dual mechanism ensures:
- Standard HTTP caching works normally with last-modified headers
- Servers can force updates using status codes when needed
- Dynamic content providers have flexibility in signaling updates

### Comprehensive Content Management

Combine both attributes for complete control:

```xml
<meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="60" 
      skipContentOnHttpStatus="403,404,500,503"
      updateContentOnHttpStatus="200,205"/>
```

Common status codes:
- **Skip codes**:
  - 404 - Not Found
  - 403 - Forbidden
  - 500 - Internal Server Error
  - 503 - Service Unavailable
- **Update codes**:
  - 200 - OK (force refresh on success)
  - 205 - Reset Content (explicit refresh request)

This is particularly useful for:
- Dynamic content feeds with varying availability
- CDN environments with custom status codes
- APIs that signal updates through HTTP status
- Servers that don't properly set last-modified headers

## URLs with Query Parameters

The SMIL Player treats URLs with different query parameters as separate files for caching purposes. This means that each unique combination of URL and query parameters will be cached independently.

### How it works

When the SMIL Player encounters URLs with query parameters, it includes those parameters in the cache file naming. This ensures that:
- Different content variations can be served using the same base URL
- Each variation is cached separately
- Query parameters can be used for tracking, versioning, or dynamic content selection

### Important Note on XML Encoding

When using query parameters in SMIL files, remember to properly XML-encode the ampersand character:
- Use `&amp;` instead of `&` between query parameters

### Example Usage

```xml
<!-- These URLs will be cached as separate files -->
<video src="https://example.com/content?adunit=ABC123&amp;id=1" region="main"></video>
<video src="https://example.com/content?adunit=ABC123&amp;id=2" region="main"></video>

<!-- Using query parameters for versioning -->
<img src="https://example.com/banner.jpg?version=2.1&amp;campaign=summer" dur="5s" region="main"></img>

<!-- Dynamic content based on parameters -->
<ref src="https://example.com/widget?location=NYC&amp;lang=en" type="text/html" dur="10s" region="main"></ref>
```

### Common Use Cases

1. **Content Variations**: Serve different content using the same base URL with different parameters
2. **Analytics Tracking**: Add tracking parameters to monitor content performance
3. **A/B Testing**: Use parameters to serve different versions for testing
4. **Dynamic Content**: Pass contextual information through query parameters

## `<prefetch>` (legacy caching method)

> The section below is to maintain compatibility with the legacy SMIL systems.

> **signageOS SMIL Player automatically caches** all files in the SMIL playlist in the internal memory and deletes old
> files which are no longer in need. You do not have to define them in the `prefetch` tag.

Media files used in SMIL are loaded "on-the-fly" as they are used for the first time. After they have been played once,
they
are kept in the cache storage. Unless storage runs out, media files are played from the cache storage when they are
played subsequently.

## Prefetching a file

The following SMIL code segment loads "movie.mpg" into the cache without playing it.

```xml

<prefetch src="http://server/movie.mpg"/>
<prefetch src="movie.mpg"/>
```

Usually it is used while media is played in foreground. See sample code in the section below.

> Relative paths have to **start with the folder or file name**. If you want to use relative paths to the SMIL playlist
> location - e.g.: `<prefetch src="movie.mpg" />`, never start the URL with `.` or `/`. That would be an invalid path. >

## Example

```xml
<!-- Parallel playback sequence, all below is happening at the same time -->
<par>

    <!-- Preloader to show something before the full content is loaded and ready -->
    <!-- This <seq> will happen first, followed by the next <seq> -->
    <seq>
        <seq repeatCount="indefinite">
            <!-- Play waiting prompt -->
            <!-- Play waiting prompt animation -->
        </seq>
    </seq>

    <!-- Download resources into the internal storage -->
    <seq>
        <prefetch src="https://demo.signageos.io/smil/zones/files/video_1.mp4"/>
        <prefetch src="https://demo.signageos.io/smil/zones/files/video_2.mp4"/>
        <prefetch src="https://demo.signageos.io/smil/zones/files/img_1.jpg"/>
        <prefetch src="https://demo.signageos.io/smil/zones/files/img_2.jpg"/>
        <prefetch src="https://demo.signageos.io/smil/zones/files/widget_image_1.png"/>
        <prefetch src="files/bottomWidget.wgt"/> <!-- Use proper path structure -->
    </seq>

    <!-- Once all preloads are ready, the playback of the full content will start -->
    <par repeatCount="indefinite">
        ....
```
